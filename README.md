# RPS
RPS is an android app that allows the user to select either Rock, Paper, or Scissor by pressing the yellow button corresponding to the that option. The app then makes a random choice for the user and determine who won. This app uses some basic android functionality: <br \>
-Buttons <br \>
-ImageView <br \>
-TextView <br \>
-onClickListeners <br \>
-Placing string literals in the string.xml file <br \>
